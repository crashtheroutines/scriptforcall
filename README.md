# Script2Call

[Русский](./docs/README_RU.md) [Spanish](./docs/README_ES.md)

**Script2Call** is an open source tool designed for call center operators.

Many call centers still store scripts in Word files or Google Docs, making work slow and inconvenient. This tool allows you to transfer scripts to a convenient interface with a breakdown by categories, which significantly speeds up work and reduces fatigue.

## What is planned to be implemented

1. **Script manager**
   Ability to import text files to avoid manual script entry.

2. **Voice templates**
   Operator voice recording with the ability to assign keys. This will allow you to include pre-recorded phrases and reduce the load on the vocal cords. Anyone who has worked 4-6 hours in a row in a call center will understand

3. **Time tracker blocker**
   Masking activity in employer monitoring systems - to reduce pressure and increase comfort at work.

4. **Modular architecture**
   The interface will support plugins and widgets to expand functionality for custom tasks.

## Note

Development is carried out in free time and is not a priority. However, the planned functions will be gradually implemented.
